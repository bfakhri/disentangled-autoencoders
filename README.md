# disentangled-autoencoders

This repository presents the final version of my Individual Project, entitled *"Experimental Study on the Properties of Disentangled Autoencoders"*, implemented during my final year (Part II) of the Computer Science Tripos at the University of Cambridge. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors, [Petar Veličković](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pv273/) and [Dr Pietro Liò](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), for their invaluable advice and endless support.
